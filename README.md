# Notes
First minor project. Meant to scribble down happenings in a day.

Written in Python 3.7 originally, but likely still good for latest version. Doesn't require any package that doesn't come automatically with Python.

If using for yourself, remember to edit the folder location to where you want. Otherwise, go silly.
